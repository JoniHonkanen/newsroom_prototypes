# AI Prototypes and Experiments

This repository contains prototypes and experimental implementations related to various ideas and subproblems.  
Each subdirectory contains a self-contained project with its own code, dependencies, and `README.md`.

These projects are intended for testing, learning, and rapid development purposes â€” not for production use.

## Structure

- Each folder is an isolated prototype or concept.
- Dependencies are defined per project (e.g. `requirements.txt`).
- Some projects may use Docker and `.env` files for testing environments.

## Notes

- Prototypes may be incomplete or exploratory by nature.
- Keep sensitive data out of version control (see `.gitignore`).
- See individual `README.md` files inside each project folder for details.

## Projects

- **news_similarity/**  
  Prototype for storing news articles as vector embeddings and finding semantically similar ones using SentenceTransformers and pgvector.

- **rss_fetching/**
  Experiments with fetching news content from RSS feeds, generating original article drafts, and enriching them with related news using semantic similarity.
