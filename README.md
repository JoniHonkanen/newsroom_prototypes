# AI Prototypes and Experiments

This repository contains prototypes and experimental implementations related to various ideas and subproblems.  
Each subdirectory contains a self-contained project with its own code, dependencies, and `README.md`.

These projects are intended for testing, learning, and rapid development purposes â€” not for production use.

## Structure

- Each folder is an isolated prototype or concept.
- Dependencies are defined per project (e.g. `requirements.txt`).
- Some projects may use Docker and `.env` files for testing environments.

## Notes

- Prototypes may be incomplete or exploratory by nature.
- Keep sensitive data out of version control (see `.gitignore`).
- See individual `README.md` files inside each project folder for details.

## Projects

- **newsroom_frontend/**  
  Next.js 15, Apollo Client, GraphQL-based multilingual news frontend with SSR and SEO support.  
  See diagrams and details in `newsroom_frontend/README.md`.

  Prototype for storing news articles as vector embeddings and finding semantically similar ones using SentenceTransformers and pgvector.

- **rss_fetching/**  
  Experiments with fetching news content from RSS feeds, generating original article drafts, and enriching them with related news using semantic similarity.

- **gradio_tool_for_news_validation/**  
  Extension of "rss_fetching". Shows process for generating and validating news, including web enrichment and logging agent reasoning.

- **Editor in Chief/**  
  Tests whether the editor-in-chief accepts or rejects real published news. Focus on prompt engineering for editorial decision-making and rationale logging.
