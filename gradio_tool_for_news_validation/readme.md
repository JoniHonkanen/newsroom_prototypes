# News Generator with Gradio UI

This project implements a multi-agent news enrichment system using **Gradio** as the user interface. The system extracts a news article from a given URL, generates a new article idea, enriches it via web search, and outputs a fully written news piece.

This project is a continuation of the earlier prototype:
https://github.com/JoniHonkanen/newsroom_prototypes/tree/main/rss_fetching

Unlike the previous version, this tool does **not use RSS feeds**.  
Instead, the user provides a single news article URL as input.

The purpose of this tool is to **demonstrate the full news generation process**  
and to **test how different parameters (model, temperature, prompts) affect the final output**.

So this is for testing purpose only and thats why may include some bugs

## üß† How It Works

1. You paste a news article URL (preferably from a Finnish site like Yle).
2. The system extracts the article content and metadata.
3. It generates:
   - A summary
   - A new article idea
   - Keywords and search queries
4. It performs a web search to find related supporting articles.
5. It then writes a new enriched article based on the original + supporting sources.

### Tabs

**Comparison**  
- Left: Original Article (Markdown)  
- Right: Enriched Article (Markdown)

**Source Articles**

**Note:** DuckDuckGo search has rate limits. To avoid failures, the system retries queries with exponential backoff (e.g., waits 2s, 4s, etc.). Some queries may still fail if limits are hit repeatedly.

## üß™ Tips

- Prompt placeholders like {article_text}, {idea}, {published_date} must be included in the templates.
- Supports real-time streaming via Gradio.
- Prompts are editable live in the UI.
